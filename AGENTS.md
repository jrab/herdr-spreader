## General Coding Guide
- Please do not worry about backward compatibility until I provide further instructions.
- Specify patch version if you add a new Rust crate to `Cargo.toml`.
- Follow functional programming style.
  - Prefer to make data immutable.
  - Specify three components: Actions, Calculation, Data (This principle is written in the book "Grokking Simplicity"). Specifically, carefully isolate Actions.
    - Actions: Depend on how many times or when it is run. Also called functions with side-effects, side-effecting functions, impure functions. Examples: Send an email, read from a database, including I/O operations.
    - Calculations: Computations from input to output. Also called pure functions, mathematical functions. Examples: Find the maximum number, check if an email address is valid.
    - Data: Facts about events. Examples: The email address a user gave us, the dollar amount read from a bank’s API.
